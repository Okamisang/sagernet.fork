#### 0.5-rc15

`This release contains many v2ray-core changes, some of which have been submitted upstream for review.`

**Override destination option**

Disabled by default.

When disabled, `AsIs` can get the same accuracy as `IPIfNonMatch` and do not require the server to
resolve the domain name again before connecting.

**Resolve destination option**

Resolve the domain (if sniffed), and overwrite the destination address based on the IPv6 Mode
selection result.

Note: There is no fallback to other ips when the connection fails.

**Concurrent DNS queries**

If you fill in more than one DNS, core will query concurrently.

**Endpoint independent mapping**

Fixed UDP address mapping behavior.

This does not work for v*ess and mux.cool; for plugins, it depends on the plugin itself.

**Fixes**

* Fixed Local DNS queries getting fallback to Remote DNS
* Fixed LwIP not work
* Other fixes

Note: you should always use gVisor if available.
